      <h2> My life so far...</h2>
      
    <p><strong> I am 12 years old. My birthday is on august, 25, 2007. I was born in Addis ababa, Ethiopia. I have 3 brothers and only one of my brothers were born in ethiopia. My family moved here in march of 2013. When i was around 7 or 8, my uncle used to always turn on NCAA basketball and i liked Basketball. I remember i used to shoot a wierd way in the first grade which was uperhand. I changed my jumpshot in the 4th grade because i saw that it was more efficent. In the 5th grade i was shooting 3 pointers, and i also started playing fortnite. When i started playing fortnite, i lost interest playing basketball. In 2018, my family went back to ethiopia i couldn't play fortnite. In 2019 i got better and when chapter 2 came out i played less and less. And now i'm interested in football and basketball and i'm doing better in school </strong></p>
