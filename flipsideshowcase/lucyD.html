  <h1> Lucy's portfolio project</h1>
  <p><strong> Hi my name is Lucy as you may know. Anyways I made this portfolio because I 1: want a windows computer and 2: because I want to show you how smart I am. Anyways I'm going to tell you about myself. I play soccer and I love doing art. I also have a pitbull and black lab mix and his name is Piper. I used to have a black cat named Pele(and no not like the soccer player). I also had a Huskey and German Sheperd mix named Sugar. I think that's everything that I can tell you about me so have a good day everyone!!!!!</strong></p>
