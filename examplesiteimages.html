    <h1>Eileen's IT Club Portfolio</h1>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Eileen King. I'm 29 years old and in 17th grade! I grew up in Chicago with my mom and three sisters, but now I live in Minnesota. I have two roommates and no pets (yet).</p>
    <p>I work at a museum and at a school. When I'm not working, I like listening to music, riding my bike, hanging out with friends, and baking cookies.</p>
      <p>Fun facts about me:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>I can play the accordion</li>
          <li>I used to be on a swim team</li>
          <li>I love working with power tools</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Why I'm here</h2>
    <p>I chose this class because I love working with technology and with other people. I want to explore how we can use computers in creative ways and have fun.</p>
